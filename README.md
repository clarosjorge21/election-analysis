# election-analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use Python to help Seth and Tom complete their audit. We are trying to find out the voter turnout for each county, percentage of votes from each county out of the total count and the county with the highest turnout. 

### Summary
Using Python we were able to create a script that would give us the results for the election. The scrip gave us the amount of total votes, the percantages of each county and the winner of the election.

### Election Audit Summary

We are able to to constantly use this program and script with future elections by just changing a few things in the script. Below you can see two codes that are in the script that if we modify we are able to change the election data but continue to use the script.

By changing the file to load code we are able to change the election results from the one we are currently using to another one as long as it is in a csv and has a similar format as this one. In the second image, we need to change just like the first image because that is the csv that the script is reading. By changing this csv we are able to run our loops and produce the results for the next election.
