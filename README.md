# election-analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use Python to help Seth and Tom complete their audit. We are trying to find out the voter turnout for each county, percentage of votes from each county out of the total count and the county with the highest turnout. 

### Summary
Using Python we were able to create a script that would give us the results for the election. The scrip gave us the amount of total votes, the percantages of each county and the winner of the election.
